AS a pretentious intellectual 

I WANT an app to easily see the books I want to read next, along with their synopsis, author and date

SO THAT I can continually maintain my intellectual status and make smart witty cultured comments when at dinner parties.
```

## Context
THE things of the app WILL go HERE.
